### Project Overview:
- User starts by creating a new account (Coach/Client).
- If the user signed as a client:
        <ul>
            <li>(he/she) can subscribe into a membership (basic/pro/premium)</li>
            <li>chat with the assigned coach</li>
            <li>organize their workout schedule</li>
        </ul>
- if the user signed as a coach:
        <ul>
            <li>(he/she) must wait for admin approval</li>
            <li>when they are approved the admin assigns some clients for them so they can start chat</li>
        </ul>
- Admin gets a dashboard that gives them the ability to:
        <ul>
            <li>register a new admin to the team</li>
            <li>view gym equipments stock</li>
            <li>view clients/coaches/subscriptions info</li>
            <li>check whether a client got a membership or not by scanning (his/her) QR-Code.</li>
        </ul>
